# Retail Customer Cohort Analysis

This project uses **Power BI** to analyze customer retention, churn, and cohort behavior in a retail business. The dashboard provides a deep dive into how different customer groups (cohorts) perform over time, highlighting trends in loyalty and reactivation.



## Key Insights

- **Churn Trends**
  - Churn rates vary significantly across cohorts, with some showing a sharp drop in retention after the first few months.
  - Highest churn observed in early months for older cohorts, while newer cohorts show slightly better early retention.

- **Customer Retention Breakdown**
  - Customers are segmented into:
    - **New Customers** – first-time buyers in the period.
    - **Recovered Customers** – previously lost customers returning.
    - **Retained Customers** – customers who continue to purchase.
  - Retained customers (blue segment) form the largest portion in later months, showing stable long-term loyalty for some cohorts.

- **Customer Acquisition & Loss Trends**
  - **Lost customers** (red) peaked in late 2011.
  - **Recovered customers** (blue) show steady growth over time.
  - **New customers** (green) trend downward, indicating a shift from acquisition-focused growth to retention-focused strategy.
