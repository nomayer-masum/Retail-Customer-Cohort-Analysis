es, you can prevent others from editing your Google Docs by adjusting the sharing settings. Here’s how to do it:

Open your Google Doc.

Click the “Share” button (top-right).

Under “Share with people and groups,” add the emails of people you want to share with (if any).

Next to their email, click the dropdown and select “Viewer” or “Commenter” — this prevents them from editing.

If you share the link, click “Change to anyone with the link” and select “Viewer” or “Commenter” instead of Editor.

This way, others can view or comment but cannot edit your document.

If you want to completely lock it for yourself (so you can’t accidentally edit), Google Docs doesn’t have a built-in “lock” for the owner, but you could:

Make a copy and keep it untouched as backup.

Use Version History to restore if accidental edits happen.

Would you like me to guide you step-by-step or suggest add-ons that can help?
